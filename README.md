entro.py
========

Simple command-line entropy calculation tool for Python.

The tool can calculate entropy for bits, nybbles, bytes, or
Unicode code points.  Try with --verbose to see the progress
of the calculation.

To use from a library,

    from entro import H, Bit, Nybble, Str, Utf8
    bit_entropy    = H(Bit(data))
    nybble_entropy = H(Nybble(data))
    byte_entropy   = H(Str(data))
    utf8_entropy   = H(Utf8(data))
